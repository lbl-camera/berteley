# Summary

Being able to discover the underlying themes and patterns in a collection of documents is necessary in order to
parse the overwhelming amount of information that is available today. Topic modeling is a Natural Language Processing
(NLP) technique that was designed specifically for this task. In early 2022 BERTopic was introduced and provided a highly
modular framework for creating customizable topic models and introducing a new method to extract the topic words from their
respective topics. This package is widely used for topic modeling on a variety of corpora. However, when conducting topic modeling
on a corpus consisting of scientific articles 

# Statement of need

`Gala` is an Astropy-affiliated Python package for galactic dynamics. Python
enables wrapping low-level languages (e.g., C) for speed without losing
flexibility or ease-of-use in the user-interface. The API for `Gala` was
designed to provide a class-based and user-friendly interface to fast (C or
Cython-optimized) implementations of common operations such as gravitational
potential and force evaluation, orbit integration, dynamical transformations,
and chaos indicators for nonlinear dynamics. `Gala` also relies heavily on and
interfaces well with the implementations of physical units and astronomical
coordinate systems in the `Astropy` package [@astropy] (`astropy.units` and
`astropy.coordinates`).

`Gala` was designed to be used by both astronomical researchers and by
students in courses on gravitational dynamics or astronomy. It has already been
used in a number of scientific publications [@Pearson:2017] and has also been
used in graduate courses on Galactic dynamics to, e.g., provide interactive
visualizations of textbook material [@Binney:2008]. The combination of speed,
design, and support for Astropy functionality in `Gala` will enable exciting
scientific explorations of forthcoming data releases from the *Gaia* mission
[@gaia] by students and experts alike.

In particular, the outdoor air temperature component includes the longwave radiation to the particles, dust, and water vapors in the ambient air. The longwave view factors to the ground and sky are calculated with the following equations [20,21]:  Fg= 0.5(1 − cos ϕ),           (2) Fsky= 0.5(1 + cos ϕ)∗β,                 (3) Fa= 0.5(1 + cos ϕ)∗(1−β),                                 (4) where ϕ is the tilt angle (the angle between the Z-axis and the normal to the surface) in degrees of the surface, β is the sky and air radiation split factor defined by:  β = √ 0.5 (1 + cos ϕ)              (5) In many urban contexts, specifically in the presence of urban canyons—relatively narrow streets with tall, continuous buildings on both sides of the roads—this assumption is flawed in two aspects. First, in most urban areas, the view factors of a building façade to surrounding buildings’ façades are not neglectable, and the temperature of the surrounding façades can be much higher or lower than the sky or ground temperature. Second, at different times of a day, the individual building surface temperature can deviate each other to a couple of degrees Celsius due to different orientations [22]. As the north façade of a building often faces the south facades of surrounding buildings, under different circumstances, some exterior zones may be absorbing heat from longwave radiation, while other zones are losing heat to the ambient. Considering this, we modified the EnergyPlus code to optionally explicitly consider the longwave radiant heat exchange to and from buildings’ nearby surfaces (i.e., surrounding buildings’ exterior surfaces, water bodies, green lands, etc.) in addition to the radiation from sky and ground as currently considered (Figure 1).

The raytracing algorithm performs Monte Carlo sampling by shooting rays between random points drawn from a pair of exterior surfaces. Each ray and its terminal points represent a discrete analog of the pair of differential area d𝐴1 and d𝐴2 in Figure 3. The ray tracer will then determine whether each ray can reach its target surface without hitting a third surface. The view factor from A1 to a target surface A2 can be then deduced as a sum of the cos𝜃1cos𝜃2𝜋𝑟2 terms over all surviving rays subject to proper normalization. Compared with the traditional analytical solutions and geometry analogy algorithms introduced in the literature review, the view factor tracer we developed carries the following advantages: 1. Rays are always directed between a pair of surfaces; 2. The obstructed surfaces are considered automatically; 3. The intersection of rays with many geometric objects can be solved analytically. This allows for efficient and robust handling of objects with non-convex and other complex shapes. 4. The computation for tracing individual rays is strictly independent and hence could be parallelized easily using GPU. Our ray tracing program is written in CUDA C++ and makes use of the NVIDIA Optix Prime library. CUDA C++ is an extension of the C++ language with syntactic features for executing codes on the CUDA GPUs. Optix Prime is a lower-level program engine that simplifies the design of ray tracing applications that executes on either CUDA GPUs or x86 CPUs. Specifically, we used Optix to compute the point of intersection between rays and urban surfaces, while our custom CUDA C++ code handles scene modeling, ray generation, result consolidation, and post-processing. A table of view factors from all exterior surfaces to all surrounding surfaces is produced by the tracer to be imported in EnergyPlus calculations. 3.

The selected district is in the downtown Chicago (LOOP) area, with a total of 22 buildings, as visualized in Figure 4(a). The district is mostly composed of mix-used buildings, ranging from 3 to 60 floors. The highest building in the chosen area has 58 floors in total, and the lowest has 5 floors. Modeling the buildings in EnergyPlus, we simplified the urban building representations in two ways: (1) for mix-used buildings, the dominant usage is considered as the building type; (2) for high-rise towers with a podium that is used as garages, we only consider the tower part in the modeling. Figure 4(b) draws the footprint of buildings in the district, colored by their dominating building use type. Among the 22 buildings, 18 are large high-rise hotels, three are low-rise retail buildings, and one is a large office building. The newest construction was completed in 2013, and the oldest was built in 1968.  (a)  (b) Energies 2020, SI, x FOR PEER REVIEW  8 of 18  Figure 4. Case study urban district in downtown Chicago. (a) Site view of the studied district; (b) Footprints and building types of the studied district. We then use CityBES to generate the EnergyPlus models for building energy simulation with the district buildings’ geographic and geometry information as input. CityBES models each building as an extruded polygon according to the building’s number of floors and height and applied zoning automatically based on the building footprint and building use type [28]. The models then infer detailed building systems and energy efficiency levels (e.g., insulation of envelope, lighting systems, HVAC systems, and equipment efficiency) based on the local building energy code of that particular year of build. The HVAC system types and efficiency levels are determined based on ASHRAE standard 90.1 [29]. Figure 5 is the CityBES visualization of the models, labeled with building IDs to facilitate further discussion.  Figure 5. Building energy models of the studied district. With the simulation set up, we follow the listed steps to conduct the case study, and the results are presented accordingly. 1. Pre-scanning the text input files of each EnergyPlus model’s geometry data to extract the coordinates of the exterior wall, windows, roofs, and surrounding surfaces to generate ray-tracing scenes for the tracer and calculating the view factor of exterior surfaces of these 22 buildings. 2. Running each EnergyPlus building model individually and independently without considering inputs from other buildings, and output their hourly exterior surfaces temperature for a whole year.  3. Collecting each building’s hourly surrounding surface temperature schedules for a whole year from the simulated exterior surface temperatures in Step 2, using the weighted average temperature (by surface area) of each façade and roof. 4. Re-running each building model taking surrounding surfaces temperature schedules and their corresponding view factors to each exterior surface.   3.2 View Factors to the Surrounding Surfaces Averaging all surfaces on a façade, Figure 6 plots the average view factors of the four façades and the roof to surrounding surfaces of each building, calculated by the ray tracer we introduced.  \fEnergies 2020, 13, 2382\n",

Among the mixed low-rise and high-rise buildings in the studied dense urban district, lots of them have an average view factor of over 0.5 for at least one façade, and the largest view factor for one façade can be up to 0.8. This indicates these buildings are mostly shadowed, viewing less to the sky and ground than standalone buildings. Moreover, buildings of different geometries and locations view their surrounding buildings differently. For example, building 13 and 14 at the central part of the district are almost equally shadowed from the four façades, while buildings at the peripheral parts of the district usually have asymmetric view factors between opposed orientations. For the low-rise buildings such as building 3 and 16, their roofs’ view factors to the surrounding high-rise buildings can be over 0.5. As roofs usually contribute the most LWR heat gain or loss to the sky, how these heat exchanges can differ with the surrounding high-rise building shadowing effects should be discussed. 3.3. Thermal Behaviors of Building Exterior Surfaces In different seasons of a year and different times of a day, the amount of solar radiation received by the four facades of buildings varies. We compared the monthly average exterior surface temperature, as shown in Figure 7, separating walls and windows. Each box plots the range of surface temperatures among all 22 studied buildings, with outliers neglected. Located in the northern hemisphere, throughout the year, the exterior wall temperature of the south façade can be 2-5 °C higher than that of the north façade. The highest temperature differences appear during the fall and winter seasons, and during these times, the south-faced facades also see a larger temperature range of up to 8 °C between buildings. Monthly average temperatures of the east and west-faced walls are close during the winter season, while during summer, east façades observe a higher temperature on average. More significantly, from April to October, the thermal behavior of the walls facing east and west varies greatly among different buildings in the district, considering the varying shadowing effect of their facades. For window surfaces, the temperature variations among different orientations and buildings are lower, due to windows having considerably lower thermal absorptance to the solar radiation.

In Figure 8 and Figure 9, we picked January 21st and July 21st as a typical winter and summer day, respectively, and compared the hourly exterior wall temperatures, averaging each facade. Due to the daily variation of the sun position angle along with the shading effect from surrounding buildings, the surface temperature of different facades peaks at different hours of the day. In winter, the highest average temperature of the east, west, and south facades was observed at 11 am, 3 pm, and 12 pm, respectively. Although different buildings have a significant variation in surface temperature throughout the day, we still observe quite notable temperature gaps between opposed orientations on average. For east and west walls, the largest gap appears in the afternoon, when west facades have over 5 °C temperatures higher than the east ones. At noontime, the south facades with the largest view angle to the sun, observe a 15 °C higher surface temperature than the north facades, which benefit the least from the solar radiation during winter.   \fEnergies 2020, 13, 2382\n",

              "'Abstract: Thermal interactions through longwave radiation exchange between buildings, especially\\nin a dense urban environment, can strongly inﬂuence a building’s energy use and environmental\\nimpact. However, these interactions are either neglected or oversimpliﬁed in urban building energy\\nmodeling. We developed a new feature in EnergyPlus to explicitly consider this term in the surface\\nheat balance calculations and developed an algorithm to batch calculating the surrounding surfaces’\\nview factors using a ray-tracing technique. We conducted a case study with a district in the Chicago\\ndowntown area to evaluate the longwave radiant heat exchange eﬀects between urban buildings.\\nResults show that the impact of the longwave radiant eﬀects on annual energy use ranges from 0.1% to\\n3.3% increase for cooling and 0.3% to 3.6% decrease for heating, varying among individual buildings.\\nAt the district level, the total energy demand increases by 1.39% for cooling and decreases 0.45% for\\nheating. We also observe the longwave radiation can increase the exterior surface temperature by up\\nto 10\\nC for certain exterior surfaces. These ﬁndings justify a detailed and accurate way to consider\\nthe thermal interactions between buildings in an urban context to inform urban planning and design.\\n\\n◦\\n\\nKeywords: thermal interaction; longwave radiation; view factor; urban building energy modeling;\\nray tracing\\n\\n1. Introduction\\n\\nBuildings consume up to 70% of the primary energy use in cities. Cities are paying considerable\\nattention to building energy eﬃciency in urban planning, and in meeting city goals for the reduction\\nof GHG emissions [1]. In dense urban areas, the urban context, including the surrounding buildings\\nand their direct individual eﬀects on a building, can strongly inﬂuence the building’s energy use and\\ndemand [2]. In the meantime, the thermal interactions between buildings, which induces radiation\\ntrapping in urban street canyons, is considered as a major factor of the urban heat island (UHI) eﬀect.\\nOn the one hand, with buildings shading each other, the longwave radiation losses toward the sky\\nare reduced, and multiple reﬂections of shortwave and longwave radiation increases the irradiation\\ntrapping [3]. Furthermore, the increased urban surface temperature and longwave irradiation to the\\nambient air contribute to a warmer micro-environment and urban atmosphere.\\n\\nWhile the thermal performance of individual buildings is well documented in general building\\nenergy simulation tools, the thermal interactions between buildings are generally less understood or not\\nconsidered [4]. In the urban context, radiant heat exchange occurs between buildings’ exterior surfaces\\nand (1) the sky, (2) the ground, and (3) other surfaces, including other buildings’ exteriors surfaces,\\n\\nEnergies 2020, 13, 2382; doi:10.3390/en13092382\\n\\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/energies\\n\\nenergies\\x1e# \\x1e&\\x01!*-\\x010+\\x1f\\x1c/ .\\x0cEnergies 2020, 13, 2382\\n\\n2 of 17\\n\\nwetlands, vegetation cover, trees, etc. Among these, the thermal interconnections between buildings\\nmainly occur via the longwave radiant (LWR) heat exchange between buildings’ exterior surfaces [5,6].\\nLiterature has introduced the processes to simulate or measure the long-wave radiant heat\\nexchange between buildings and their surrounding urban surfaces [7]. Urban sensing is one way to\\nquantify heat transfer. Kwon and Lee [8] conducted measurements and collected data to investigate\\nshifts in LWR over time, depending on spatial aspects, focusing on trees, buildings, and their sizes.\\nThe results demonstrated that a 50 % increase in tree volume induced a 10% decrease in mean\\nradiant temperature (MRT). Ghandehari et al. [9] estimated the urban radiant heat transfer based\\non hyperspectral imaging of building blocks in Manhattan, New York. The study also introduced a\\ngeospatial radiosity model to describe the physical processes of LWR heat exchange between buildings.\\nIn this model, the urban geometry (building and street surfaces) is represented by a mesh of small\\nsurface “patches”. Similar radiosity methods are commonly adopted in most urban microclimate\\nsimulations [10]. Among these simulation methods, view factors between urban surfaces are calculated\\nby diﬀerential area view angle calculation [11] or Monte Carlo Ray Tracing (MCRT) sampling\\napproach [12]. However, these studies within the urban microclimate domain lack granularity\\nin building physics, including detailed geometries, system conﬁgurations, and physical processes\\n(e.g., lighting, HVAC) inside buildings.\\n\\nIn urban building energy modeling, various approaches have been introduced to the treatment\\nof external LWR exchange in urban energy modeling to simulate the thermal interactions between\\nbuildings. Algorithms and tools were developed to address the need for modeling building energy in\\nan urban context, considering the surrounding buildings [7]. Urban building energy modeling (UBEM)\\ntools have been developed to simulate an urban district considering energy ﬂow between buildings\\nfor planning purposes. Evins et al. [13] coupled EnergyPlus with the microclimate tool, ENVI-Met,\\nto improve the longwave exchange process of building energy modeling considering other building\\nsurfaces. The case study results indicated that the combined impact of the street canyon and shading\\ndevices led to an increase in the surface temperature of up to 6 °C, a decrease in annual heating load\\nof 18%, and an increase in the cooling load of 19%. A similar study by Miller et al. [14] included the\\nLWR exchange as part of a co-simulation process of an urban scale simulation program, CitySim,\\nand EnergyPlus. The LWR exchange between surfaces was computed in CitySim by a linearization\\nof the energy balance using the temperature diﬀerence between surfaces and their environment.\\nThey then used functional mockup units (FMU) for coupling weather and load simulations, and the\\nresults indicate an up to 36% discrepancy in heating and 11% in cooling load calculations between\\nindividual and coupled simulations. However, both studies simpliﬁed the physical processes due to\\nthe limitation of the simulation engine and computing resources. The coupled physics also prevents\\nthe simulation from scaling up to apply the model in a larger urban domain.\\n\\nEnergyPlus [15] is the U.S. Department of Energy’s ﬂagship building energy software for simulating\\nthe dynamic energy and environmental performance of buildings. An EnergyPlus model calculates a\\nbuilding’s thermal loads, system response to those loads, and resulting energy use, along with related\\nmetrics like occupant comfort and energy costs. Applied to urban energy modeling, EnergyPlus\\ncalculates the overall thermal behavior of the urban buildings in terms of urban boundary conditions\\n(i.e., exterior surface temperatures) and the heat and airﬂow exchange with the urban environment [16].\\nYet in older versions, EnergyPlus models buildings as standalone entities and physical processes.\\nTraditionally in EnergyPlus, calculations for LWR heat exchange between exterior surfaces and their\\nsurrounding surfaces were over-simpliﬁed, considering only the radiative heat exchange from and to\\nthe sky and the ground. However, in a dense urban setting with lots of high-rise buildings, these eﬀects\\ncan be large and can have impacts on building energy and environmental performance. Thus, this\\nsimpliﬁcation is causing potential under or over-estimate of buildings’ energy consumption and\\nexterior surface temperatures. Explicitly considering the thermal interconnections between buildings\\nin an urban context requires simulation engines to evolve to incorporate this new information into\\n\\n\\x0cEnergies 2020, 13, 2382\\n\\n3 of 17\\n\\ncalculations and to do in a scalable way that achieves feasible computing performance and accuracy\\nfor urban scale applications.\\n\\nApart from the simulation engine to be involved, view factors between urban surfaces are\\nalso required to calculate the LWR heat exchanges in an urban scene.\\nIn radiative heat transfer,\\na view factor from surface A to B is the proportion of the radiation which leaves surface A that\\nstrikes surface B. The analytical calculation of view factors between urban surfaces is computationally\\nexpensive considering the complex urban geometry. Alternatively, ray tracing has been widely adopted\\nto simplify the calculation. Ray tracing is a computer graphics algorithm originally proposed for\\ngenerating photorealistic renderings by emulating the transmission of light rays in 3D scenes. In this\\nalgorithm, a large number of rays are shot from a source region into the scene, while the intersection\\nbetween the rays and scene objects are then solved and used to recursively compute a path of the ray\\nbouncing between object surfaces. Panao et al. used the ray-tracing method to determine the view\\nfactors in a 3D regular urban area by simplifying the urban block geometry [17]. The four vertical\\nfaçades, the sky, and the ground are divided into parcels, and the estimation of the view factor matrix\\nis calculated by shooting a large number of rays from each parcel with a random direction and tracking\\nthe surfaces they intersect. However, due to the limited computing resource, the parcels are divided\\ncoarsely in a large urban scene, and this sacriﬁces the accuracy when the scene is complex. Jones et al.\\nhave also presented a ray casting method of calculating view factors between two interior building\\nsurfaces on the basis of the geometric analogy algorithms [18,19]. To calculate a view factor from surface\\nA to B, a Monte Carlo approximation is produced by selecting points on surface A and casting one ray\\nfrom each point. The view factor is then calculated as the fraction of rays whose ﬁrst intersection is\\nwith surface B. The approximation can also be used in calculating exterior surfaces’ view factors in an\\nurban district scene. The simulation engines, such as EnergyPlus, can take advantage of these faster\\nalgorithms by integrating the external calculation results into urban building energy simulation.\\n\\nThis paper presents the feature implemented in EnergyPlus version 8.8 and later to improve its\\naccuracy in an urban context by considering thermal interactions between buildings and expanding its\\napplicability to urban scale building energy simulation. This paper also introduces a GPU-accelerated\\nray tracer for computing the view factors between large numbers of urban surfaces eﬃciently.\\nThe feature is introduced along with a case study of an urban district in the downtown Chicago area\\nto demonstrate its use and impact. The study addresses the need for taking explicit consideration of\\nthe thermal interactions between urban surfaces in a dense urban setting with high-rise buildings.\\nIn urban-scale modeling applications, this new feature enables modeling the urban canyon eﬀect,\\nwhich also inﬂuences the building’s energy demand and indoor occupant thermal comfort. The study\\nalso demonstrated how modern computing architecture enables the massive amount of calculation\\nrequired for considering buildings’ thermal interactions in urban energy modeling, and the potential\\nto apply the algorithms in a larger spatial scale of urban building energy simulation and coupled\\nmultiscale urban systems.\\n\\n2. Thermal Interactions between Buildings\\n\\n2.1. Modeling Longwave Radiant Heat Exchange between Buildings in EnergyPlus\\n\\nOld versions of EnergyPlus assumed that the temperatures of exterior surfaces of surrounding\\nnearby buildings are essentially uniform and that longwave radiant exchange between them is\\nnegligible.

The longwave view factors to the ground and\\nsky are calculated with the following equations [20,21]:\\n\\nFg = 0.5(1 − cos φ),\\nFsky = 0.5(1 + cos φ)∗β,\\nFa = 0.5(1 + cos φ) ∗ (1 − β),\\n\\n(2)\\n\\n(3)\\n\\n(4)\\n\\nwhere φ is the tilt angle (the angle between the Z-axis and the normal to the surface) in degrees of the\\nsurface, β is the sky and air radiation split factor deﬁned by:\\n\\n(cid:113)\\n\\nβ =\\n\\n0.5 (1 + cos φ)\\n\\n(5)\\n\\nIn many urban contexts, speciﬁcally in the presence of urban canyons—relatively narrow streets\\nwith tall, continuous buildings on both sides of the roads—this assumption is ﬂawed in two aspects.\\nFirst, in most urban areas, the view factors of a building façade to surrounding buildings’ façades are\\nnot neglectable, and the temperature of the surrounding façades can be much higher or lower than\\nthe sky or ground temperature.

In particular, the outdoor air temperature component includes the longwave radiation to the particles, dust, and water vapors in the ambient air. The longwave view factors to the ground and sky are calculated with the following equations [20,21]:  Fg= 0.5(1 − cos ϕ),           (2) Fsky= 0.5(1 + cos ϕ)∗β,                 (3) Fa= 0.5(1 + cos ϕ)∗(1−β),                                 (4) where ϕ is the tilt angle (the angle between the Z-axis and the normal to the surface) in degrees of the surface, β is the sky and air radiation split factor defined by:  β = √ 0.5 (1 + cos ϕ)              (5) In many urban contexts, specifically in the presence of urban canyons—relatively narrow streets with tall, continuous buildings on both sides of the roads—this assumption is flawed in two aspects. First, in most urban areas, the view factors of a building façade to surrounding buildings’ façades are not neglectable, and the temperature of the surrounding façades can be much higher or lower than the sky or ground temperature. Second, at different times of a day, the individual building surface temperature can deviate each other to a couple of degrees Celsius due to different orientations [22]. As the north façade of a building often faces the south facades of surrounding buildings, under different circumstances, some exterior zones may be absorbing heat from longwave radiation, while other zones are losing heat to the ambient. Considering this, we modified the EnergyPlus code to optionally explicitly consider the longwave radiant heat exchange to and from buildings’ nearby surfaces (i.e., surrounding buildings’ exterior surfaces, water bodies, green lands, etc.) in addition to the radiation from sky and ground as currently considered (Figure 1).

Modeling Urban Buildings and Their Surrounding Surfaces\\n\\nWe use the CityBES platform to model buildings in the urban context. CityBES is an open and free\\ndata and computing web platform which uses CityGML-based 3D city models to simulate building\\nperformance at the urban scale, adopting EnergyPlus and OpenStudio as its simulation engines [24].\\nCityBES models the neighborhood buildings as shading surfaces in EnergyPlus to consider the solar\\novershadowing eﬀect between buildings [25]. Instead of calculating the view factor of each surface\\nof the domain building to every surface of a surrounding building, we adopt the shading surfaces\\ndeﬁned in CityBES as a building’s surrounding surfaces and calculate their view factors to each\\nexterior surface for radiant heat exchange calculation including windows, walls, and roofs of each\\nexterior zone. Figure 2 shows the 3D visualization of a building model along with its surrounding\\nbuildings (grey surfaces). Speciﬁcally, when the closest ground distance of the target building and\\na surrounding building is less than the height multiplier times the surrounding building’s height,\\nthe surrounding building may shade the target building, so the surrounding building is considered as\\na shading building for the target building. The height multiplier is calculated based on an average sun\\n\\n\\x0cEnergies 2020, 13, 2382\\n\\n6 of 17\\n\\nangle of a certain location as a simpliﬁcation.

Buildings’ average view factors of different orientations to surrounding surfaces. Among the mixed low-rise and high-rise buildings in the studied dense urban district, lots of them have an average view factor of over 0.5 for at least one façade, and the largest view factor for one façade can be up to 0.8. This indicates these buildings are mostly shadowed, viewing less to the sky and ground than standalone buildings. Moreover, buildings of different geometries and locations view their surrounding buildings differently. For example, building 13 and 14 at the central part of the district are almost equally shadowed from the four façades, while buildings at the peripheral parts of the district usually have asymmetric view factors between opposed orientations. For the low-rise buildings such as building 3 and 16, their roofs’ view factors to the surrounding high-rise buildings can be over 0.5. As roofs usually contribute the most LWR heat gain or loss to the sky, how these heat exchanges can differ with the surrounding high-rise building shadowing effects should be discussed. 3.3. Thermal Behaviors of Building Exterior Surfaces In different seasons of a year and different times of a day, the amount of solar radiation received by the four facades of buildings varies. We compared the monthly average exterior surface temperature, as shown in Figure 7, separating walls and windows. Each box plots the range of surface temperatures among all 22 studied buildings, with outliers neglected. Located in the northern hemisphere, throughout the year, the exterior wall temperature of the south façade can be 2-5 °C higher than that of the north façade. The highest temperature differences appear during the fall and winter seasons, and during these times, the south-faced facades also see a larger temperature range of up to 8 °C between buildings. Monthly average temperatures of the east and west-faced walls are close during the winter season, while during summer, east façades observe a higher temperature on average. More significantly, from April to October, the thermal behavior of the walls facing east and west varies greatly among different buildings in the district, considering the varying shadowing effect of their facades. For window surfaces, the temperature variations among different orientations and buildings are lower, due to windows having considerably lower thermal absorptance to the solar radiation.

Discussion\\n\\nThe results show the thermal interactions between buildings should not be neglected when some\\nsurfaces of a building are surrounded by other buildings’ surfaces which receive a great amount of\\nsolar radiation and have signiﬁcantly higher surface temperatures. A low-rise building surrounded\\nby high-rise buildings is an example of this eﬀect, as the roof and facades of four orientations are all\\nradiated by urban surfaces with a higher temperature than the sky, air, or ground. The shadowing\\neﬀect between two urban surfaces, in general, mitigates this impact, as when surfaces are mostly\\nshaded, the timely and seasonally temperature diﬀerences between the two surfaces are not obvious\\nthroughout a year.\\n\\nHowever, this case study may not unveil all aspects of this eﬀect. First, the study does not consider\\nthe thermal exchange with urban objects such as trees or shading by trees; Second, each façade is\\ntreated as a lump surface with a uniform temperature in considering its LWR impact on surrounding\\nsurfaces. In reality, the façade has many surfaces with diﬀerent temperatures and view factors to\\nsurrounding surfaces; Third, the studied area consists the most of hotel and apartment buildings.\\nA larger community with more diverse building types and conﬁgurations may demonstrate varied\\nenergy behavior, as the energy demands peak at diﬀerent times of a day. Moreover, it is also worth\\nconsidering the irradiation trapping eﬀect by conducting the case study iteratively, updating the\\nexterior surface temperatures at every iteration until they converge. A ﬁner coupling resolution with\\ndata exchange hourly or daily is required for this analysis, and a coupled simulation architecture may\\nhelp facilitate it.\\n\\nOverall, the study introduced an approach to considering LWR from surrounding surfaces explicitly\\nin urban building energy modeling using the EnergyPlus simulation engine. The term was neglected\\ndue to the complexity of calculating the view factors and temperatures of the surrounding surfaces.\\nComparing to the literature, the case study results indicate the radiant heat exchange between buildings\\nhas varying impacts on buildings’ cooling and heating energy demand and exterior surface temperature,\\nwhich in turn can intensify the heat stress in the urban microclimate environment. Comparably, the\\ncase study includes details of the variation of the building types, geometries, and layouts as the\\nrepresentation of a real building district, and the results show diﬀerent levels of energy demand\\nchanges to individual buildings, reﬂecting more granularity of the long-wave radiation impact.\\n\\nFuture work includes implementing the thermal interactions in an urban building energy\\nmodeling platform, such as CityBES, for simulation of the urban building performance. View factors\\nof surrounding surfaces will be pre-calculated altogether using the ray tracing tool and stored for\\nsimulation use. The platform would allow studying more districts with diﬀerent density and locations.\\nMore simulation at a higher ﬁdelity and a large spatial domain would allow investigating the coupling\\nresolution and its inﬂuence on accuracy. Furthermore, coupled simulation with urban microclimate\\nand climate models allows quantifying the impact on pedestrians’ outdoor thermal comfort and how\\nthe irradiation trapping and increased urban surface temperature contribute to the UHI.\\n\\n5. Conclusions\\n\\nThis paper presents a new feature implemented in EnergyPlus version 8.8 and later to improve its\\nuse for building energy modeling by considering the longwave radiation eﬀect between buildings’\\nexterior surfaces. A case study was conducted within a city block in the Chicago downtown area\\nwith 22 highly dense mixed-used buildings. Results indicate the temperature diﬀerence between\\neach building façade and its surrounding surfaces with opposite orientations leads to signiﬁcant\\nradiance heat exchange between building exterior surfaces. Results also show that this temperature\\ngap between building surfaces and their surrounding building surfaces causes the net thermal heat\\n\\n\\x0cEnergies 2020, 13, 2382\\n\\n16 of 17\\n\\ngain of a building from its surrounding buildings, which induces the variations in exterior surface\\ntemperature, building loads, and energy use. In particular, for the studied district located at the\\nmid-latitude area in the northern hemisphere, the longwave radiation from the surrounding surfaces\\nto the roof accounts for most cooling demand increase, and that to the north façade accounts for most\\nheating demand decrease.\\n\\nThe study addresses the need for taking explicit consideration of the thermal interactions between\\nurban surfaces in a dense urban setting with high-rise buildings. More detailed quantiﬁcation and\\nvalidation of the eﬀects of building interactions at a larger scale can improve the accuracy of urban\\nbuilding energy modeling.\\n\\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, X.L. and T.H.; Methodology, X.L. and Y.-H.T.; Software, X.L. and\\nY.-H.T.; Validation, X.L.; Formal Analysis, X.L.; Investigation, X.L.; Resources, T.H. and Y.-H.T.; Data Curation,\\nX.L.; Writing—Original Draft Preparation, X.L.; Writing—Review & Editing, T.H. and Y.-H.T.; Visualization, X.L.;\\nSupervision, T.H.; Project Administration, T.H.; Funding Acquisition, T.H.
